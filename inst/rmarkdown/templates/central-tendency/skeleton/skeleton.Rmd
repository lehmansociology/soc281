title: "Measures of Central Tendency"

In this lab you will decide whether mean, median, and mode can be calculated for a variety of variables, and then calculate as appropriate.

As always, we need to start by loading our libraries.  Go ahead and run line 13 below.

```{r}

library('soc281')
library('lehmansociology')

```

Next, we need to load our data.  As we used for the last lab, we'll use the "states" dataset that is pre-loaded into R.  We just need to call up this dataset and format it.  Go ahead and run the lines below without modification.

```{r}

data(state, list=character(), package="datasets", lib.loc=NULL, envir=.GlobalEnv)
states<-data.frame(state.x77)

states.1<-data.frame(state.region)

states$Region <- states.1$state.region

```

Below are examples of the functions for mean, median, and mode.  Each function is named by the measure of central tendency we want to calculate - that is they are mean(), median(), and MODE().  Within the parentheses, we put the name of the dataset, then the $, then the name of the variable to specify what we are calculating the mean, median, or mode of.  Go ahead and run the lines below, one at a time, to see their corresponding results.  Note the mode function is written in all caps.

```{r}

mean(states$Population)

median(states$Income)

MODE(states$Region)

```

Now you will calculate mean, median, and/or mode for variables in the states dataset.  For each variable listed below, decide whether mean, median, and/or mode are meaningful measures, then calculate only the ones that are appropriate.  Use the space below for the variable Illiteracy.  This is the percent of the population that is illiterate.

```{r}



```

Use the space below for the variable Life.Exp.  This is the life expectancy at birth, measured in years.

```{r}



```

Use the space below for the variable Murder.  This is the number of murders that occured per 10,000 persons in the population.

```{r}



```

Use the space below for the variable Frost.  This is the mean number of days per year that a particular location in the state experiences below-freezing temperatures.

```{r}


```

Use the space below for the variable HS.Grad.  This is the percent of the population that has graduated high school.

```{r}



```

Use the space below for the variable Region.  This is the geographic region that the state falls within (Northeast, South, North Central, or West)

```{r}



```

Now, go ahead and knit to PDF, Word, or HTML, export the file, and upload to Blackboard for this homework assignment.
